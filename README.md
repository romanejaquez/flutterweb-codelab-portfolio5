# Flutter Web Codelab (pt.5) - Web Local Storage via SharedPreferences 

## Overview

Welcome to the exciting world of Flutter Web! In this codelab we'll learn how to tap into your browser's local storage to store non-critical data - in our case, we'll persist the last navigated page so we can restore it when the user reloads the page.

In this codelab, we'll accomplish the following:

- Store non-critical data to the browser's local storage through the **shared_preferences** package
- Install the **shared_preference** package
- Create the required providers to supply the loaded SharedPreferences instance
- Create the logic around storing and retrieving the selected navigation route
- Integrate the logic into the app

We'll use the [shared_preferences](https://pub.dev/packages/shared_preferences) package for this.
